# Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin

![Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](brand/jekyll_multiple_languages_plugin_logo.png)

Jekyll Multiple Languages is an internationalization plugin for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It compiles your Jekyll site for one or more languages with a similar approach as Rails does. The different sites will be stored in subfolders with the same name as the language it contains.

The plugin was developed as a utility at [Daresay](https://daresay.co)

## 1. Current Release Notice

1.6.0 is the current stable release.

The support for Octopress is dropped, but the plugin should still work with it since Octopress core is Jekyll.
Octopress 3 now has its own multi languages plugin: https://github.com/octopress/multilingual

## 2. Features

* Supports multiple languages with the same code base.
* Supports all template languages that your Liquid pipeline supports.
* Uses [Liquid tags](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) in your HTML for including translated strings.
* Compiles the site multiple times for all supported languages into separate subfolders.
* Works with the --watch flag turned on and will rebuild all languages automatically.
* Contains an example website, thanks to [@davrandom](https://github.com/davrandom/)
* Supports translated keys in YAML format
* Supports translated template files
* Supports translated links

## 3. Installation

### 3.1. Using the gem

This plugin is available as a Ruby gem, https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin'
```

And then execute: `$ bundle install`

Or install it yourself as: `$ gem install jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin`

To activate the plugin add it to the Jekyll `_config.yml` file, under the `plugins` option:

```ruby
plugins:
  - jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin
```
See the [Jekyll configuration documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration) for details.

### 3.2. Manually

1. Download the repository with Git or your preferred method.
2. Inside your Jekyll `_plugins` folder, create a new folder called `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin`.
3. Copy or link the directory `lib`, that is inside the downloaded repository, into your `_plugins/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` folder of your Jekyll project.

### 3.3. As a Git Submodule

If your Jekyll project is in a git repository, you can easily manage your plugins by utilizing git submodules.

To install this plugin as a git submodule:

```sh
$ git submodule add git://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin.git _plugins/multiple-languages
```

To update:

```sh
$ cd _plugins/multiple-languages
$ git pull origin master
```

## 4. Configuration

### 4.1. _config.yml

Add the languages available in your website into your _config.yml (obligatory):

```yaml
languages: ["sv", "en", "de", "fr"]
```

The first language in the array will be the default language, English, German and French will be added into separate subfolders.

To avoid redundancy, it is possible to exclude files and folders from being copied to the localization folders.

```yaml
exclude_from_localizations: ["javascript", "images", "css"]
```

Instead of adding all your posts under the `i18n` directory (with subfolders like: `_i18n/{sv,en,de,fr}/_posts`), you can define a custom parameter to add your posts into or keep the `_posts` directory so you will have a structure like `_posts/{sv,en,de,fr}/`, just add the following parameter:

```
localized_posts_dir: _posts
```


In code, these specific files should be referenced via `baseurl_root`. E.g.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ "/css/bootstrap.css" | prepend: site.baseurl_root }}"/>
```

If you wish to avoid having the default_lang built into the root of your website, use:

```yaml
default_locale_in_subfolder: true
```

### 4.2. Folder structure

Create a folder called `_i18n` and add sub-folders for each language, using the same names used on the `languages` setting on the `_config.yml`:

  - /_i18n/sv.yml
  - /_i18n/en.yml
  - /_i18n/de.yml
  - /_i18n/fr.yml
  - /_i18n/sv/pagename/blockname.md
  - /_i18n/en/pagename/blockname.md
  - /_i18n/de/pagename/blockname.md
  - /_i18n/fr/pagename/blockname.md

## 5. Usage

### 5.1. Translating strings

To add a translated string into your web page, use one of these liquid tags:

```liquid
{% t key %}
or
{% translate key %}
```

This will pick the correct string from the `language.yml` file during compilation.

The language.yml files are written in YAML syntax which caters for a simple grouping of strings.

```yaml
global:
  swedish: Svenska
  english: English
pages:
  home: Home
  work: Work
```

  To access the `english` key, use one of these tags:

```liquid
{% t global.english %}
or
{% translate global.english %}
```

You can also access translated strings by accessing the `site.translations` hash, this allows you to loop through your translations within Liquid using the translated string's index:

```liquid
{% for item in site.translations[site.lang].my_nested_yaml_collection %}
    <p>{{ item[0] }} -> {{ item[1] }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

or the translated string's assignment:

```yaml
my_nested_yaml_collection:
  -
    title: First
    message: Message
  -
    title: Second
    message: Message

```

```liquid
{% for item in site.translations[site.lang].my_nested_yaml_collection %}
   <li>
      <h2>{{ item["title"] }}</h2>
      <p>{{ item["message"] }}</p>
   </li>
{% endfor %}
```

### 5.2. Including translated files

The plugin also supports using different markdown files for different languages using the liquid tag:

```liquid
{% tf pagename/blockname.md %}
or
{% translate_file pagename/blockname.md %}
```

This plugin has exactly the same support and syntax as the Jekyll's built in liquid tag:

```liquid
{% include file %}
```

so plugins that extend its functionality should be picked up by this plugin as well.

### 5.3. Permalinks and Translating Links

To use localized pages with permalinks, you must provide a default `permalink` and the language specific permalinks, for example, `permalink_fr` for French.

To translate links, you must also add a **unique namespace** on the YAML front matter along with the permalinks.

Example:

```yaml
---
layout:         default

namespace:     team

permalink:      /team/
permalink_fr:   /equipe/
---
```

And then you can use the translate link liquid tag like this:

```liquid
<a href="{% tl team %}"> <!--This link will return /team if we are in the English version of the website and /fr/equipe if it's the French version</a>-->

<a href="{% tl team fr %}"> <!--This link will always return /fr/equipe</a>-->

or the longer version:

<a href="{% translate_link team %}"> <!--This link will return /team if we are in the English version of the website and /fr/equipe if it's the french version</a>-->

<a href="{% translate_link team fr %}"> <!--This link will always return /fr/equipe</a>-->
```

### 5.4. i18n in templates

Sometimes it is convenient to add keys even in template files. This works in the exact same way as in ordinary files, however sometimes it can be useful to include a different string in different pages even if they use the same template.

A perfect example is this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% t page.title %}</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

So how can I add different translated titles to all pages? Don't worry, it's easy. The Multiple Languages plugin supports Liquid variables, as well as strings so, define a page variable in your page definition

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: titles.home
---
```

and `<title>{% t page.title %}</title>` will pick up the `titles.home` key from `language.yml`

```yaml
titles:
  home: "Home"
```

### 5.5. Link between languages

This plugin gives you the variables

```liquid
{{ site.lang }}

and

{{ site.baseurl_root }}
```

to play with in your template files.

This allows you to create solutions like this:

``` liquid
{% if site.lang == "sv" %}
  {% capture link1 %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}/en{{ page.url}}{% endcapture %}
  <a href="{{ link1 }}" >{% t global.english %}</a>
{% elsif site.lang == "en" %}
  {% capture link2 %}{{ site.baseurl_root }}{{ page.url  }}{% endcapture %}
  <a href="{{ link2 }}" >{% t global.swedish %}</a>
{% endif %}
```

This snippet will create a link that will toggle between Swedish and English. A more detailed description of the variables used follows:

| Name              | Value                                                         | Example                    |
| ----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| site.lang         | The language used in the current compilation stage            | ``` en ```                 |
| site.baseurl      | Points to the root of the site including the current language | ``` http://foo.bar/en ```  |
| site.baseurl_root | Points to the root of the page without the language path      | ``` http://foo.bar ```     |
| page.url          | The current page's relative URL to the baseurl                | ``` /a/sub/folder/page/ ```|

### 5.6. Creating pages

Depending on the theme, or your preferences, you need to create a "template" page in the root folder or in a folder (ex. `_pages`). Inside each page (in this example an `about.md`) you should have at least the following in the header and body:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: About
permalink: /about/
---

{% translate_file about/about.md %}
```

Inside each of the language folders, you should create mirror pages to provide the actual content for that language (ex. `i18n/es/about/about.md`). Make sure to erase the headers from those md files, or else your site will break.

### 5.7. Creating posts

There are no global posts. The posts are localized by language. And your posts will live in the `_i18n/[lang]/_posts` directory. So if, for example, you have English language on your website you should put your posts on `_i18n/en/_posts` directory.

### 5.8. Select pages to translations

Sometimes you want to generate only selected versions of the page, especially excluding default language. You can do this using languages tag.

Example:
```yaml
---
permalink:      /team/
permalink_fr:   /equipe/

languages: ["fr"]
---
```

This generate only french version of the page.

## 6. License

This project is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

## 7. Example website

This repository has an example website where you can test the plugin.
After downloading the repository, get into the `example` directory and run: `bundle install` to install the newest version of Jekyll (edit the Gemfile to install another version) and all other dependencies.

Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server. Using your web browser, access the address `http://localhost:4000`.

### 7.1. Adding a new language

Imagine you want to add German pages on the test website. First, add a new language to the list of languages on `_config.yml`:
```ruby
languages: ["it", "en", "es", "de"]
```

Create a new folder for the language under the `_i18n` folder and add a markdown file containing the translation, just like on the other language folders, and you're done.

### 7.2. Adding new page

Let's say you want to create an about page for the example website, you will create an `about.html` page on the root of the website (same place as index.html), with this:

```
---
layout: page
title: About
permalink: /about/
---

{% translate_file about/about.md %}
```

Then, create a file named `about.md` under `_i18n/en` with the English content. Repeat this for the other languages (_i18n/es/about.md ...). When running the website, visit the address `http://localhost:4000/about` to see the English version, `http://localhost:4000/es/about` for the Spanish one, etc.
